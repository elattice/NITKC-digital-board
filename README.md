# Traffic Information Board

A system for displaying upcoming bus and train departure times on a large monitor.

- Display board (`/`): Shows upcoming departures in the style of an electronic information board.
- Admin page (`/admin`): Replaces the timetable data by importing a CSV file.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technologies |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | Vite / React / TypeScript / Tailwind CSS |
| Backend | Go / chi / SQLite (modernc.org/sqlite) |

Data flow: CSV → SQLite → Go API → React UI

## CSV Format

Use [docs/open-campus-holiday-timetable.csv](docs/open-campus-holiday-timetable.csv) as a reference when creating a timetable. Save the file as UTF-8 CSV. The first row must contain the following header in exactly this order:

```csv
kind,route_name,destination,departure_time,platform
```

Add one departure per row. For example:

```csv
kind,route_name,destination,departure_time,platform
bus,大楽毛線,釧路駅,07:40,高専前
train,根室本線,釧路方面,07:27,
```

| Column | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | Yes | Transport type. Use only `bus` or `train`. |
| `route_name` | Yes | Route or line name shown on the display board. |
| `destination` | Yes | Destination shown on the display board. |
| `departure_time` | Yes | Departure time in zero-padded 24-hour `HH:MM` format, such as `07:40` or `15:25`. |
| `platform` | For buses | Bus stop or boarding location. This may be left empty for trains, but the final comma must remain. |

Important notes:

- Do not add, remove, rename, or reorder columns.
- Include every departure needed for the day in the same file.
- Importing a CSV replaces the entire existing timetable.
- Japanese text is supported when the file is saved as UTF-8. In Excel, select the UTF-8 CSV format when exporting.
- After importing the file from `/admin`, confirm that the number of imported rows and the displayed timetable are correct.
